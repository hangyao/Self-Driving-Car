# Traffic Sign Classifier

## Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Project 2

In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks were used to classify traffic signs. Specifically, a model was trained to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

## Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** with the following libraries installed:

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/index.html)
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

## Code

The completed code is provided in the notebook `Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb` notebook file. 

Another tutorial code is also provided in the notebook `traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb` notebook file. This code requires [Keras](https://keras.io/) library installed.

## Run

Make sure you are in the top-level project directory `Udacity_SDCND_traffic-signs/` (that contains this README). Then run:

```
jupyter notebook Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb
```
